Here are some basic ideas for some characters:

## 1. Sheriff (default)

Your classic lone gunslinger. Man against the world sorta situation.
Your default gun wielder sort of tutorial character with bread and butter abilities.

## 2. Hangman

Maybe a melee build? Dude has the executioner's hood on and is ready to use on-death mechanics or something.

## 3. Young Whippersnapper

I'm thinking this is a little baby with a pacifier and a whip. Long range melee options here.

## 4. The Cultist

Some sort of magic build. Maybe health sacrifice shenanigans.
