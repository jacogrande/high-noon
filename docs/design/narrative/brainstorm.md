# NARRATIVE BRAINSTORM

**Main Idea**: The game will have more of a roguelite narrative aspect than a lot of other games in the genre. Rather than just a bullet hell shoot-em-up, we'll have it be goal oriented.

Each stage will have a key event (special stage type or boss battle). These events will have success conditions (beat the boss), soft failures (failed to stop the bridge from blowing up), and hard failures (you die).

The outcome of each stage's special events modify the next stage. this ends up being a sort of branching tree of narrative progression.

I don't want this to be the main part of the game, but it should add a sense of uniqueness to runs. The events / stages also shouldn't be so focused on one narrative thing that players get upset when they encounter a certain event that they don't like.

## Fake example to demonstrate this concept

Here's one progression that I don't think is good, but demonstrates this progression idea.

1. Goblins are attacking the town. Players need to save the mayor from being kidnapped by the goblin king. As they approach the king, he releases an Ogre Brute (boss). Players need to survive and beat the boss, and they can optionally get around and deal the king enough damage to save the mayor. If they fail to do that, the king escapes with the mayor. Let's say, in this case, the players fail.
2. Now, the players are traveling through the whispering woods, making their way to the goblin camp. Here, they encounter a band of mercenaries who are also looking for the goblin king since there's a bounty on his head. If they had successfully saved the mayor, this would've been different. The players have to fight off the mercenaries now.
   etc.

## STAGE 1

Players always start in a procedurally generated town. However, different events (bosses) have an equal chance of occurring. These set the unique paths of each game.
