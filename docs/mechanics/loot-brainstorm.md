I don't think we should handle loot like risk of rain. I think, instead, we should have procedural chests or loot sources throughout the map (enemies can drop items for rng), chests open when interacted with, maybe there a special stage-level quest rewards.
Then, bosses drop high level loot.

As the player plays, they should get money. Then, between stages (as players take a "long rest" and heal / restore all abilities) there can be a random camp visitor.

- Trade Caravan : sells items / upgrades for gold
- Tinkerer : offers weapon upgrades / evolutions for gold
- Shaman : offers powerful boons that come with huge downsides (ie +50% hp for players, but monsters get +50% move speed)
